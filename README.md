# near-dragon-ball-nft

==================

This Dragon Ball NFT project. The client can mint and collect Dragon Ball NFT randomly and the NFT from their own wallet. 
It heavily borrowed the code from https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial and https://github.com/near-examples/NFT.
The only contribution of the author is Dragon Ball NFT preparation and Random NFT Mint Part.


This app was initialized with [create-near-app]. Since the author has front end experience, the front end part has been removed.


Quick Start
===========

If you haven't installed dependencies during setup:

    npm run deps-install


Build and deploy your contract to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy

Test your contract:

    npm test


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The smart-contract code lives in the `/contract` folder. 
   It has 

2. Test your contract: `npm test`, this will run the tests in `integration-tests` directory.


Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. 
When you run `npm run deploy`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a temporary dev account.
When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how:


Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `npm install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: deploy the contract
---------------------------

Use the CLI to deploy the contract to TestNet with your account ID.
Replace `PATH_TO_WASM_FILE` with the `wasm` that was generated in `contract` build directory.

    near deploy --accountId near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --wasmFile PATH_TO_WASM_FILE


Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.
